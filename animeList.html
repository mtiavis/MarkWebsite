        watched. Some fantastic, others goods, and many questionable. The
        descriptions for now are just copy pasted from
        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/" target="_blank">MyAnimeList</a>. The descriptions have my quick summary of the
        show and thoughts that I have with it.Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Fusce ac dui ac nulla euismod porttitor. Vivamus tristique pretium velit ut pharetra. Morbi magna erat, lacinia et sapien sit amet, placerat congue risus. Nulla facilisi. Sed eu massa neque. Donec at sem sed magna pulvinar luctus. Nunc vitae velit pharetra, convallis justo a, lobortis nisi. Donec non consequat ipsum. Sed mi arcu, accumsan id tellus a, suscipit tristique urna.

    <h3>Kino's Journey (NOT THE 2017 version):</h3>

    <div id="aniContent1">

      <iframe width="724" height="479" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZVgHN8cfy1I" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen id = "aniOp1"></iframe>
      <!-- width="560" height="315" -->
      <p class = "aniText">So the main character is named a young boy named Kino
        who has a talking motorcycle named Hermes. No this is not weird and the
        motorcycle is not annoying. They go to different cities that have
        different customs and traditions that are fun to watch about.
        There's a story about a city who puts all their faith in a church which
        leads to them believing that the end of the world is near and another story
        of a city where everyone can read each others thoughts. It makes the viewer
        wonder "what would happen if a city like this did exist".</p>

    <h3>Kubikiri Cycle:</h3>

    <div id="aniContent2">
      <img width = "300" height = "300" class = "aniImage" src = "animePictures/behead.jpg">
      <iframe width="724" height="479" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZgYwJ0HPirA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen id = "aniOp2"></iframe>
      <!-- width="560" height="315" -->
      <p class = "aniText">If you ever read an Agatha Christie book, then this
          show has that feeling to it. There is an island in the middle of nowhere
          that houses all sorts of "geniuses". There's a genius in art, cooking,
          programming, and much more. However, a murder occurs one night and now
          it is up for the characters to stay alive and capture the murderer. I
          personally liked the "impossible murder scenarios" that makes you really
          stump on how a murder was even achieved.</p>
