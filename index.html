    <h2>About</h2>
    <p class = "description">Hey there, so I am not sure what this website is going to turn into.
      Honestly, I just have this to practice HTML and CSS. So far I practiced
      putting text on screen, stylizing it, positioning, putting pics and vids
      on pages, practicing input with javascript, and a little bit of APIs.
      API stands for application programming interface -> this is used in the
      pokemon webpage.
    </p>

    <h3>Pokemon</h3>
    <p class = "description">Probably the hardest thing I did with this website.
      Used the PokeAPI as the database for collecting information about Pokemon's
      weaknesses and resistances based on what the user inputs into the textbox
      Had to learn a lot of javascript just for this.
    </p>

    <h3>Anime List</h3>
    <p class = "description">So as the name suggests it's my anime list
      that is not limited to 2020. The list is not in any
      particular order. Just shows that I enjoyed. They'll have a brief description
      and links to trailers and funny moments. I used it to practice embedding
      videos, pictures, and links. Also learned a lot of positioning on that site.
    </p>

    <h3>Calculator</h3>
    <p class = "description">Okay I need to change this site later, I legit copied
      a lot of stuff from tutorials for this just because I really needed to learn
      about inputs and buttons so that I could have done the pokemon webpage.
      The menu there is not even complete. Credit goes to Zell Liew.

    <h3>Joke</h3>
    <p class = "description">Don't do it. Oh also you can press the website title
      at the top of this page to come back to the homepage.
